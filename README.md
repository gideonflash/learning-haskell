# Learning haskell

I have been on and off with haskell. A language on my bucket list that i have wanted to tick off for very long time. Coming from the javascript and rust i cant seem to scratch the thought that there seems to be well of functional ideas out there where these languages drink from once in a while, the amount of times i have heard, "concept x is like haskell how haskell does x" has really got me intrested in seeing what its all about. So here is to the official journey to really figuring out what haskell is about. From asbsolute beginner to who knows.. something not beginner i guess

### What is in this repo

- All the things i am learning during my haskell journey
- Currently an uncondensded veiw of coding examples of concepts i am learning in haskell

### What to expect from this repo

- Currently i am going through topic to get a better understanding of what haskell is all about eventually this repo will turn into a reference i can use
- This is just to catalogue my progress through learning haskell not consumable at the moment as a learning resource

### Resourse i am using

- Haskell programming from first principles [link](https://haskellbook.com/)
- Haskell real world [link](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/)
